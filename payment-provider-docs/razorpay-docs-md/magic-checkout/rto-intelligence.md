With Razorpay Magic Checkout, you can lower RTO (Return To Origin) rates by assessing the likelihood of RTO for incoming orders in real time. Based on the data, you can make decisions during order placement, such as disabling the COD option. Additionally, you can use post-order data to determine whether to ship the order or take further action.

**Handy Tips**

This is an on-demand feature. Write to us at [[magic-checkout-support@razorpay.com](mailto:magic-checkout-support@razorpay.com)](mailto:magic-checkout-support@razorpay.com)

to get this feature enabled on your account.

## Use Cases

Here are some examples of how you can leverage RTO Intelligence.

- **Custom Checkout Experience**
  Businesses with custom-built stores and a dedicated checkout experience can greatly benefit from Magic Checkout. They can opt for RTO intelligence as it is a separate offering, allowing them to maintain complete control of the checkout process while effectively addressing their RTO challenges.
- **Website or App**
  Businesses operating exclusively through websites, apps, or both can benefit substantially from RTO Intelligence. Smaller businesses with limited engineering resources can easily use RTO Intelligence, an API-based solution requiring minimal integration.
- **Logistics Partners and Aggregators**
  These partners are essential for order fulfilment, processing a high volume of orders daily, and collecting customer data. While they have access to this data, they may need more expertise to build their own RTO solutions. This is where RTO Intelligence can help them enhance their capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Razorpay account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signup)  .
- Generate the [API keys](/razorpay-docs-md/api/authentication.md#generate-api-keys)

  from the Dashboard. You can use the **Test Mode** keys for testing and later switch to **Live Mode**, generate the [Live API keys](/razorpay-docs-md/api/authentication.md#live-mode-api-keys)

  and replace it with the test keys.

## Integration Steps

Perform the following integration steps:

1. [Create an Order](/razorpay-docs-md/magic-checkout/rto-intelligence.md#step-1-create-an-order)

   .
2. [View RTO/Risk Reasons](/razorpay-docs-md/magic-checkout/rto-intelligence.md#step-2-view-rto-risk-reasons)

   .
3. [Update Fulfilment Details](/razorpay-docs-md/magic-checkout/rto-intelligence.md#step-3-update-fulfilment-details)

   .

### Step 1: Create an Order

You can create an order using the following API and send the additional information required for Magic Checkout.

Pass the `order_id` received in response in the subsequent API calls as the identifier of the order.
