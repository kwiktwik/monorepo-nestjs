<!-- Source: https://razorpay.com/docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction -->

You can create an authorisation transaction using [Razorpay APIs](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#11-using-razorpay-apis) or [Registration Link](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#12-using-a-registration-link).

## 1.1. Using Razorpay APIs

To create an authorisation transaction using Razorpay APIs, you need to:

1. [Create a Customer](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#111-create-a-customer)

   .
2. [Create an Order](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#112-create-an-order)

   .
3. [Create Authorisation Payment using Razorpay APIs](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#113-create-an-authorisation-payment)

   .

**Handy Tips**

For the Authorisation Payment to be successful in a day (for example, 5th June), you should create an Order and the Authorisation Transaction on the same day (5th June) before 11:59 pm.

### 1.1.1. Create a Customer

Razorpay links recurring tokens to customers using a unique identifier generated through the Customer API.

You can create [customers](/razorpay-docs-md/api/customers.md) with basic information such as `email` and `contact` and use them for various Razorpay offerings. The following endpoint creates a customer.

POST

/customers

Sample Code

Request Parameters

name

`string` The name of the customer. For example, `Gaurav Kumar`.

email

`string` The email address of the customer. For example, `gaurav.kumar@example.com`.

contact

`string` The phone number of the customer. For example, `9876543210`.

fail\_existing

optional

`string` The request throws an exception by default if a customer with the exact details already exists. You can pass an additional parameter `fail_existing` to get the existing customer's details in the response. Possible values:

- `1` (default): If a customer with the same details already exists, throws an error.
- `0`: If a customer with the same details already exists, fetches details of the existing customer.

notes

optional

`object` Key-value pair that can be used to store additional information about the entity. Maximum 15 key-value pairs, 256 characters (maximum) each. For example, `"note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”`.

Response Parameters

id

`string` The unique identifier of the customer. For example `cust_1Aa00000000001`.

entity

`string` The name of the entity. Here, it is `customer`.

name

`string` The name of the customer. For example, `Gaurav Kumar`.

email

`string` The email address of the customer. For example, `gaurav.kumar@example.com`.

contact

`string` The phone number of the customer. For example, `9876543210`.

notes

`object` Key-value pair that can be used to store additional information about the entity. Maximum 15 key-value pairs, 256 characters (maximum) each. For example, `"note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”`.

created\_at

`integer` A Unix timestamp, at which the customer was created.

You can create an order once you create a customer for the payment authorisation.

### 1.1.2. Create an Order

The Orders API allows you to create a unique Razorpay `order_id`, for example, `order_1Aa00000000001`, that would be tied to the authorisation transaction. Refer to our detailed [Order documentation](/razorpay-docs-md/orders.md) for more details.

Use the below endpoint to create an order.

POST

/orders

You can create a payment against the `order_id` once it is generated.

Request Parameters

amount

mandatory

`integer` Amount in currency subunits. For cards, the minimum value is `100`, that is, ₹1.

currency

mandatory

`string` The 3-letter ISO currency code for the payment.

customer\_id

mandatory

`string` The unique identifier of the customer. For example, `cust_1Aa00000000001`.

token

`object` Details related to the authorisation such as max amount, frequency and expiry information.

max\_amount

mandatory

`integer` The maximum amount that can be auto-debited in a single charge. The minimum value is `100`, that is, ₹1, and the maximum value is `1500000`, that is, ₹15,000. For an amount higher than this, the cardholder should provide an Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) as per RBI guidelines.

expire\_at

mandatory

`integer` The Unix timestamp that indicates when the authorisation transaction must expire. The default value is 10 years.

frequency

mandatory

`string` The frequency at which you can charge your customer. Currently supported frequencies are `as_presented` and `monthly`. The support for other frequencies is expected to be live soon.

receipt

optional

`string` A user-entered unique identifier for the order. For example, `Receipt No. 1`. This parameter should be mapped to the `order_id` sent by Razorpay.

notes

optional

`json object` Key-value pair that can be used to store additional information about the entity. Maximum 15 key-value pairs, 256 characters (maximum) each. For example, `"note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”`.

Response Parameters

id

`string` A unique identifier of the order created. For example `order_1Aa00000000002`.

entity

`string` The entity that has been created. Here it is `order`.

amount

`integer` Amount in currency subunits. For cards, the amount should be `100`, that is, ₹1.

created\_at

`integer` The Unix timestamp at which the order was created.

You can create a payment against the `order_id` after you create an order.

### 1.1.3. Create an Authorisation Payment

**Handler Function vs Callback URL**

- **Handler Function**:

  When you use the handler function, the response object of the successful payment (`razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_order_id` and `razorpay_signature`) is submitted to the Checkout Form. You need to collect these and send them to your server.
- **Callback URL**:

  When you use a Callback URL, the response object of the successful payment (`razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_order_id` and `razorpay_signature`) is submitted to the Callback URL.

Additional Checkout Fields

customer\_id

mandatory

`string` Unique identifier of the customer created in the [first step](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#111-create-a-customer).

order\_id

mandatory

`string` Unique identifier of the order created in the [second step](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#112-create-an-order).

recurring

mandatory

`boolean` Possible values:

- `true`: Recurring payment is enabled.
- `false`: Recurring payment is not enabled.

**Handy Tips**

The `recurring` parameter also supports the value `preferred`. Use this when you want to support **recurring payments** and **one-time payment** in the same flow.

save

mandatory

`integer` Indicates whether to save the card details. Possible values:

- `1`: Save the card details.
- `0`: Do not save the card details.

consent\_to\_save\_card

mandatory

`integer` Indicates whether you have taken the customer's consent for tokenising the card. Possible values:

- `1`: Taken the customer's consent.
- `0`: Not taken the customer's consent.

After this step, you can proceed to integrate with the [Fetch Token API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/tokens.md).

## 1.2. Using a Registration Link

Registration Link is an alternate way of creating an authorisation transaction. You can create a registration link using the [API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/custom/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md#121-create-a-registration-link) or [Dashboard](/razorpay-docs-md/recurring-payments/create.md#1-create-a-registration-link).

**Handy Tips**

- You do not have to create a customer if you choose the registration link method for creating an authorisation transaction.
- You can [use Webhooks to get notifications about successful payments](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#check-authorization-link-status-using-webhooks)

  against a registration link.

When you create a registration link, an [invoice](/razorpay-docs-md/invoices.md) is automatically issued to the customer. They can use this invoice to make the authorisation payment.

A registration link must always have the amount (in Paise) that the customer will be charged when making the authorisation payment. For cards, the amount must be a minimum of `₹1`.
