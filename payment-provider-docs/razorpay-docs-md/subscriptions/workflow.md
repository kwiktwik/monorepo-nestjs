Understand the Subscription flow and how to create Subscriptions from the Checkout or using links.

## Subscription Life Cycle

The following diagram depicts the Subscriptions life cycle:

![Subscriptions Lifecycle stages and flow](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/subscriptions/build/browser/assets/images/subscriptions-subscriptions-workflow-overview.jpg)

1. [Create a Plan](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/create.md#plan)

   .
2. After the Plan is created, you can then [create a Subscription](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/create.md#subscription)

   for your customer.
3. Customer makes the [Authentication Transaction](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/create.md#authentication-transaction)   .
4. The Subscription becomes active when the billing cycle starts.

**Handy Tips**

- You do not need to capture any Subscriptions-related payment. All payments related to Subscriptions (except the authorisation payment) are **auto-captured**. The authorisation payment used to validate a customer's card is **auto-refunded**.
- There is no need to create a customer when using Razorpay Subscriptions. Razorpay automatically creates a customer when the authentication payment is made.

## Authentication Transaction

The **authentication transaction** amount is the first amount you charge on the customer's card. The authentication transaction can either be a token amount that is refunded to the customer or an upfront amount or the plan amount that is not refunded to the customer. Based on your business needs, you can decide on the authentication transaction amount.

**Immediate Start Dates**

In case of immediate start dates, the authentication transaction amount is not refunded and invoices are generated in all the three scenarios.

Authentication Amount - Various Combinations

The following table below explains what authentication amount is collected from customers for various combinations of start date and the upfront amount.

You can collect the authentication transaction using Subscription via Checkout or using Subscription Links.

**Handy Tips**

You can [integrate Subscriptions](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/integration-guide.md) into your checkout only using [Subscriptions APIs](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/subscriptions.md).

You can integrate Razorpay Subscriptions with your Razorpay Checkout Form on your website or application. Customers can select their desired Subscription Plan on your website or application and proceed to make the authentication payment using Razorpay's Checkout.

1. [Create a Plan](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/create.md#plan)

   .
2. The customer selects the Plan from your website or application.
3. After the customer selects a Plan, a Subscription is created in Razorpay and the `subscription_id` received in the response, is passed on to the Razorpay Checkout via the checkout options.
4. On the Checkout form, the customer makes the payment using the card details.
5. This acts as an **authentication transaction**. On a successful payment, a customer is created and linked to the Subscription.
6. Automated charges on the Subscription are now made as per the schedule that you defined while creating the plan.

## Subscriptions Actions

You can perform the following actions on Subscriptions that are active:

- [Update a Subscription](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/update.md)
- [Pause and Resume a Subscription](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/pause-resume-cancel.md)
- [Cancel a Subscription](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/pause-resume-cancel.md#cancel-a-subscription-via-the-dashboard)

## Invoice

Invoices are automatically created for Subscriptions. Invoice includes details such as plan, amount, date of charge including merchant details. Invoices are created for every charge made on the customer's card for recurring payments, including the authentication transaction.

- An invoice is generated at the beginning of each billing cycle for the defined plan and amount.
- A charge is attempted on the invoice. The invoice is in `issued` state on your Dashboard.
- If the charge is successful:
  - An email is sent to the customer.
  - The invoice is moved to `paid` state on your Dashboard.
  - The `invoice.paid` webhook is fired.

Know more about the [Subscription states](/razorpay-docs-md/subscriptions/states.md).

**Watch Out!**

Along with the invoice state, we recommend you check the Subscription charge status of the defined billing frequency before providing or continuing services to your customers.
