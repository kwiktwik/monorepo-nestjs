Consider these steps before taking the integration live.

## Accept Live Payments

Perform an end-to-end simulation of funds flow in the Test Mode. Once confident that the integration is working as expected, switch to the Live Mode and start accepting payments from customers.

**Watch Out!**

Ensure you are switching your test API keys with API keys generated in Live Mode.

To generate API Keys in Live Mode on your Razorpay Dashboard:

1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and switch to **Live Mode** on the menu.
2. Navigate to **Account & Settings** → **API Keys** → **Generate Key** to generate the API Key for Live Mode.
3. Download the keys and save them securely.
4. Replace the Test API Key with the Live Key in the Checkout code and start accepting actual payments.

## Payment Capture

After payment is `authorized`, you need to capture it to settle the amount to your bank account as per the settlement schedule. Payments that are not captured are auto-refunded after a fixed time.

**Watch Out**

- You should deliver the products or services to your customers only after the payment is captured. Razorpay automatically refunds all the uncaptured payments.
- You can track the payment status using our [Fetch a Payment API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments.md#fetch-a-payment)

  or webhooks.

Auto-capture Payments (Recommended)

Manually Capture Payments

Authorized payments can be automatically captured. You can auto-capture all payments [using global settings](/razorpay-docs-md/payments/capture-settings.md#auto-capture-all-payments) on the Razorpay Dashboard. Know more about [capture settings for payments](/razorpay-docs-md/payments/capture-settings.md).

**Watch Out!**

Payment capture settings work only if you have integrated with Orders API on your server side. Know more about the [Orders API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders/create.md).

## Set Up Webhooks

Ensure you have [set up webhooks](/docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments/) in the live mode and configured the events for which you want to receive notifications.

**Implementation Considerations**

Webhooks are the primary and most efficient method for event notifications. They are delivered asynchronously in near real-time. For critical user-facing flows that need instant confirmation (like showing "Payment Successful" immediately), supplement webhooks with API verification.

**Recommended approach**

- Rely on webhooks for all automation, which can be asynchronous.
- If a critical user-facing flow requires instant status, but the webhook notification has not arrived within the time mandated by your business needs, perform an immediate API Fetch call ( [Payments](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/fetch-with-id.md)  , [Orders](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders/fetch-with-id.md)

  and [Refunds](/razorpay-docs-md/api/refunds/fetch-specific-refund-payment.md)

  ) to verify the status.
