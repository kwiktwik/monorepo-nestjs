## Integrate With Razorpay Payment Gateway

Start accepting domestic and international payments from customers on your website using the Razorpay Payment Gateway. Razorpay has developed the Standard Checkout method and manages it. You can configure **payment methods, orders, company logo** and also select **custom colour** based on your convenience. Razorpay supports these [payment methods](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-methods.md) and [international currencies](/razorpay-docs-md/international-payments.md#supported-currencies).

![Configure .NET integrated payment gateway checkout based on your requirement](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/server-integration/java/build/browser/assets/images/web-integration-checkout-new.jpg)

Watch this video to know how to integrate Razorpay Payment Gateway on your Java-based website.

#### Sample App

We recommend you check the [Java Sample App](/razorpay-docs-md/server-integration/java/build/browser/assets/images/razorpay-java-sample-project.md), created using the video tutorial.

#### GitHub Repository

Download the latest [razorpay-java.zip](https://github.com/razorpay/razorpay-java/releases/) file from GitHub. It is pre-compiled to include all dependencies.

### Project Structure

Before you begin, we recommend you check the [Java Sample App](/razorpay-docs-md/server-integration/java/build/browser/assets/images/razorpay-java-sample-project.md), created using the video tutorial and verify that your project contains the following files:

**Before you proceed:**

- Create a [Razorpay account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signup)  .
- Generate the [API Keys](/razorpay-docs-md/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys)

  from the Dashboard. To go live with the integration and start accepting real payments, generate Live Mode API Keys and replace them in the integration.
- Know about the [Payment Flow](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-gateway/how-it-works.md)

  and follow these integration steps:

#### 1. Build Integration

Integrate with your Java-based website.

#### 2. Test Integration

Test the integration by making a test payment.

#### 3. Go-live Checklist

Check the go-live checklist.

### 1. Build Integration

1.1 Create an Order in Server

Order is an important step in the payment process.

- An order should be created for every payment.
- You can create an order using the [Orders API](/razorpay-docs-md/server-integration/java/integration-steps.md#api-sample-code)  . It is a server-side API call.  Know how to [authenticate](/razorpay-docs-md/api/authentication.md#generate-api-keys)

  Orders API.
- The `order_id` received in the response should be passed to the checkout. This ties the Order with the payment and secures the request from being tampered.

**Watch Out!**

Payments made without an `order_id` cannot be captured and will be automatically refunded. You must create an order before initiating payments to ensure proper payment processing.

**Handy Tips**

You can capture payments automatically with one-time [Payment Capture setting configuration](/razorpay-docs-md/server-integration/java/integration-steps.md#3-go-live-checklist) on the Dashboard.

1.1.1 Sample Code

In the sample app, the **PaymentController.java** file contains the code for order creation using Orders API.

RequestResponse

copy

```java
RazorpayClient razorpay = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

JSONObject orderRequest = new JSONObject();
orderRequest.put("amount",50000); // Amount is in currency subunits. 
orderRequest.put("currency","");
orderRequest.put("receipt", "receipt#1");
JSONObject notes = new JSONObject();
notes.put("notes_key_1","Tea, Earl Grey, Hot");
orderRequest.put("notes",notes);

Order order = instance.orders.create(orderRequest);
```

1.1.2 Request Parameters

Here is the list of parameters for creating an order:

amount

mandatory

`integer` Payment amount in the smallest currency sub-unit. For example, if the amount to be charged is ₹299, then pass `29900` in this field. In the case of three decimal currencies, such as KWD, BHD and OMR, to accept a payment of 295.991, pass the value as 295990. And in the case of zero decimal currencies such as JPY, to accept a payment of 295, pass the value as 295.

**Watch Out!**

As per payment guidelines, you should pass the last decimal number as 0 for three decimal currency payments. For example, if you want to charge a customer 99.991 KD for a transaction, you should pass the value for the amount parameter as `99990` and not `99991`.

currency

mandatory

`string` The currency in which the transaction should be made. See the [list of supported currencies](/razorpay-docs-md/international-payments.md#supported-currencies). Length must be 3 characters.

**Handy Tips**

Razorpay has added support for zero decimal currencies, such as JPY, and three decimal currencies, such as KWD, BHD, and OMR, allowing businesses to accept international payments in these currencies. Know more about [Currency Conversion](/razorpay-docs-md/international-payments/currency-conversion.md)

(May 2024).

receipt

optional

`string` Your receipt id for this order should be passed here. Maximum length is 40 characters.

notes

optional

`json object` Key-value pair that can be used to store additional information about the entity. Maximum 15 key-value pairs, 256 characters (maximum) each. For example, `"note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”`.

partial\_payment

optional

`boolean` Indicates whether the customer can make a partial payment. Possible values:

- `true`: The customer can make partial payments.
- `false` (default): The customer cannot make partial payments.

first\_payment\_min\_amount

optional

`integer` Minimum amount that must be paid by the customer as the first partial payment. For example, if an amount of ₹7,000 is to be received from the customer in two installments of #1 - ₹5,000, #2 - ₹2,000 then you can set this value as `500000`. This parameter should be passed only if `partial_payment` is `true`.

Know more about [Orders API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders.md).

1.1.3 Response Parameters

Descriptions for the response parameters are present in the [Orders Entity](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders/entity.md) table.

1.1.4 Error Response Parameters

The error response parameters are available in the [API Reference Guide](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders.md#error-response-parameters).

1.2 Add Checkout Options

Add the Razorpay Checkout options to your project. For example, if you are using HTML for your frontend, create a page called **index.html** and add the Pay button on your web page using the checkout code and either the callback URL or handler function.

1.2.1 Callback URL or Handler Function

1.2.2 Code to Add Pay Button

Copy-paste the parameters as `options` in your code:

Handler Function (JavaScript) Checkout CodeCallback URL (JavaScript) Checkout Code

        alert(response.error.code);
        alert(response.error.description);
        alert(response.error.source);
        alert(response.error.step);
        alert(response.error.reason);
        alert(response.error.metadata.order_id);
        alert(response.error.metadata.payment_id);
});
document.getElementById('rzp-button1').onclick = function(e){
    rzp1.open();
    e.preventDefault();
}
</script>

**Handy Tips**

The open method of Razorpay object (`rzp1.open()`) must be invoked by your site's JavaScript, which may or may not be a user-driven action such as a click.

1.2.4 Handle Payment Success and Failure

The way the Payment Success and Failure scenarios are handled depends on the [Checkout Sample Code](/razorpay-docs-md/server-integration/java/integration-steps.md#122-code-to-add-pay-button) you used in the last step.

Checkout with Callback URL

If you used the sample code with the callback URL:

On Payment Success

On Payment Failure

Razorpay makes a POST call to the callback URL with the **razorpay\_payment\_id**, **razorpay\_order\_id** and **razorpay\_signature** in the response object of the successful payment. Only successful authorisations are auto-submitted.

Checkout with Handler Function

If you used the sample code with the handler function:

On Payment Success

On Payment Failure

The customer sees your website page. The checkout returns the response object of the successful payment (**razorpay\_payment\_id**, **razorpay\_order\_id** and **razorpay\_signature**). Collect these and send them to your server.

Use the Success/Failure Handling code given below:

Success Handling CodeFailure Handling Code

copy

```javascript
"handler": function (response){
    alert(response.razorpay_payment_id);
    alert(response.razorpay_order_id);
    alert(response.razorpay_signature)}
```

1.2.5 Configure Payment Methods *(Optional)*

Multiple payment methods are available on Razorpay Standard Checkout.

- The payment methods are **fixed** and cannot be changed.
- You can configure the order or make certain payment methods prominent. Know more about configuring payment methods. Know more about [configuring payment methods](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/configure-payment-methods.md)  .

1.3 Store Fields in Your Server

A successful payment returns the following fields to the Checkout form.

Success Callback

- You need to store these fields in your server.
- You can confirm the authenticity of these details by verifying the signature in the next step.

razorpay\_payment\_id

`string` Unique identifier for the payment returned by Checkout **only** for successful payments.

razorpay\_order\_id

`string` Unique identifier for the order returned by Checkout.

razorpay\_signature

`string` Signature returned by the Checkout. This is used to verify the payment.

1.4 Verify Payment Signature

This is a mandatory step that allows you to confirm the authenticity of the details returned to the checkout for successful payments.

To verify the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the checkout:

1. Create a signature in your server using the following attributes:
2. Use the SHA256 algorithm, the `razorpay_payment_id` and the `order_id` to construct an HMAC hex digest as shown below:

   copy

   ```
generated_signature = hmac_sha256(order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id, secret);

    if (generated_signature == razorpay_signature) {
    payment is successful
    }
```
3. If the signature you generate on your server matches the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the checkout, the payment received is from an authentic source.

   Use the code given below to generate signature on your server:

   Verify Payment Signature

   copy

   ```java
RazorpayClient razorpay = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

String secret = "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";

JSONObject options = new JSONObject();
options.put("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3");
options.put("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.put("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f");

boolean status =  Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options, secret);
```

1.5 Verify Payment Status

**Handy Tips**

On the Dashboard, ensure that the payment status is `captured`. Refer to the payment capture settings page to know how to [capture payments automatically](/razorpay-docs-md/payments/capture-settings.md).

You can track the payment status in three ways:

Verify Status from Dashboard

Subscribe to Webhook Events

Poll APIs

To verify the payment status from the Dashboard:

1. Log in to the Dashboard and navigate to **Transactions** → **Payments**.
2. Check if a **Payment Id** has been generated and note the status. In case of a successful payment, the status is marked as **Captured**.

![Check if the payment id is generated and the status is captured](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/server-integration/java/build/browser/assets/images/testpayment.jpg)

### 2. Test Integration

After the integration is complete, a **Pay** button appears on your webpage/app.

![Test integration on your webpage/app](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/server-integration/java/build/browser/assets/images/test-int.gif)

Click the button and make a test transaction to ensure the integration is working as expected. You can start accepting actual payments from your customers once the test transaction is successful.

**Watch Out!**

This is a mock payment page that uses your test API keys, test card and payment details.

- Ensure you have entered only your [Test Mode API keys](/razorpay-docs-md/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys)

  in the Checkout code.
- Test mode features a mock bank page with **Success** and **Failure** buttons to replicate the live payment experience.
- No real money is deducted due to the usage of test API keys. This is a simulated transaction.

Following are all the payment modes that the customer can use to complete the payment on the Checkout. Some of them are available by default, while others may require approval from us. Raise a request from the Dashboard to enable such payment methods.

You can make test payments using one of the payment methods configured at the Checkout.

Netbanking

You can select any of the listed banks. After choosing a bank, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment `success` or a `failure`. Since this is Test Mode, we will not redirect you to the bank login portals.

Check the list of [supported banks](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-methods/netbanking.md#supported-banks).

UPI

You can enter one of the following UPI IDs:

- `success@razorpay`: To make the payment successful.
- `failure@razorpay`: To fail the payment.

Check the list of [supported UPI flows](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-methods/upi.md).

**Handy Tips**

You can use **Test Mode** to test UPI payments, and **Live Mode** for UPI Intent and QR payments.

Cards

You can use the following test cards to test transactions for your integration in Test Mode.

### Domestic Cards

Use the following test cards for Indian payments:

#### Error Scenarios

Use these test cards to simulate payment errors. See the [complete list](/razorpay-docs-md/payments/test-card-details.md#error-scenario-test-cards) of error test cards with detailed scenarios.
Check the following lists:

- [Supported Card Networks](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-methods/cards.md)

  .
- [Cards Error Codes](/docs/errors/payments/cards/)

  .

### International Cards

Use the following test cards to test international payments. Use any valid expiration date in the future in the MM/YY format and any random CVV to create a successful payment.

Check the list of [supported card networks](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-methods/cards.md).

Wallet

You can select any of the listed wallets. After choosing a wallet, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment `success` or a `failure`. Since this is Test Mode, we will not redirect you to the wallet login portals.

Check the list of [supported wallets](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-methods/wallets.md#supported-wallets).

### 3. Go-live Checklist

Check the go-live checklist for Razorpay Web Standard Checkout integration. Consider these steps before taking the integration live.

3.1 Accept Live Payments

Perform an end-to-end simulation of funds flow in the Test Mode. Once confident that the integration is working as expected, switch to the Live Mode and start accepting payments from customers.

**Watch Out!**

Ensure you are switching your test API keys with API keys generated in Live Mode.

To generate API Keys in Live Mode on your Razorpay Dashboard:

1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and switch to **Live Mode** on the menu.
2. Navigate to **Account & Settings** → **API Keys** → **Generate Key** to generate the API Key for Live Mode.
3. Download the keys and save them securely.
4. Replace the Test API Key with the Live Key in the Checkout code and start accepting actual payments.

3.2 Payment Capture

After payment is `authorized`, you need to capture it to settle the amount to your bank account as per the settlement schedule. Payments that are not captured are auto-refunded after a fixed time.

**Watch Out**

- You should deliver the products or services to your customers only after the payment is captured. Razorpay automatically refunds all the uncaptured payments.
- You can track the payment status using our [Fetch a Payment API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments.md#fetch-a-payment)

  or webhooks.

Auto-capture Payments (Recommended)

Manually Capture Payments

Authorized payments can be automatically captured. You can auto-capture all payments [using global settings](/razorpay-docs-md/payments/capture-settings.md#auto-capture-all-payments) on the Razorpay Dashboard. Know more about [capture settings for payments](/razorpay-docs-md/payments/capture-settings.md).

**Watch Out!**

Payment capture settings work only if you have integrated with Orders API on your server side. Know more about the [Orders API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders/create.md).

3.3 Set Up Webhooks

Ensure you have [set up webhooks](/docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments/) in the live mode and configured the events for which you want to receive notifications.

**Implementation Considerations**

Webhooks are the primary and most efficient method for event notifications. They are delivered asynchronously in near real-time. For critical user-facing flows that need instant confirmation (like showing "Payment Successful" immediately), supplement webhooks with API verification.

**Recommended approach**

- Rely on webhooks for all automation, which can be asynchronous.
- If a critical user-facing flow requires instant status, but the webhook notification has not arrived within the time mandated by your business needs, perform an immediate API Fetch call ( [Payments](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/fetch-with-id.md)  , [Orders](/razorpay-docs-md/api/orders/fetch-with-id.md)

  and [Refunds](/razorpay-docs-md/api/refunds/fetch-specific-refund-payment.md)

  ) to verify the status.
