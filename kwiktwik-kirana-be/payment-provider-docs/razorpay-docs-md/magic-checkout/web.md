Follow these steps to integrate the Razorpay Magic Checkout on your website.

#### Prerequisites

- [Create a Razorpay account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/)

  .
- Generate [API Keys](/razorpay-docs-md/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys)

  from the Dashboard. To go live with the integration and start accepting real payments, generate Live Mode API Keys and replace them in the integration.

## Integration Steps

Follow the steps given below:

1.1 Enable/Disable Magic Checkout and Cash on Delivery

Enable Magic Checkout

Enable Cash on Delivery Payment Method

Raise a request with your Razorpay SPOC to get this feature enabled on your account.
Once this feature is enabled, the customer address saving and coupon features are enabled.

1.2 Create Promotions and Shipping Info API Endpoints

Follow the steps given below to create promotions and shipping info API endpoints:

**Watch Out!**

Ensure that the URLs are publicly accessible, require no authentication and are hosted on your server.

1. Log in to the Dashboard and navigate to **Magic Checkout**.
2. In the **Platform Setup**, select **Custom E-Commerce Platform** from the drop-down list and click **Next**.

   ![Choose custom platform](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/magic-checkout/build/browser/assets/images/magic-custom-platform.jpg)
3. In the **Setup & Settings** section, click **Checkout Settings**.
4. In the **Coupon Settings** section, enter the following:
   1. **URL for get promotions**: The API URL should return a list of promotions applicable to the specified order\_id and customer. Magic Checkout uses this endpoint to fetch these promotions from your server and display them to your customers in the checkout modal.
   2. **URL for apply promotions**: The API URL validates the promotion code applied by the customer and should return the discount amount. Magic Checkout uses this endpoint to apply promotions via your server.
5. Click **Save settings**.

   ![Add promotion URLs](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/magic-checkout/build/browser/assets/images/magic-web-promo-url.jpg)
6. Navigate to **Shipping Setup**.
7. Select **API** as the Shipping Service type from the drop-down list.
8. Enter the **URL for shipping info**. The API URL should return shipping serviceability, COD serviceability, shipping fees and COD fees for a given list of customer addresses. Magic Checkout uses this endpoint to retrieve shipping information from your server.
9. Click **Save Settings**.

   ![Add shipping URL](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/magic-checkout/build/browser/assets/images/magic-web-shipping-url.jpg)

1.3 Create an Order

You can create an order using the following API and send the additional information required for Magic Checkout. Pass the `order_id` received in response to the checkout code.

Pre-discount Handling

Example

copy

```json
{
  "amount": 45000,           // ₹500 - ₹50 discount = ₹450
  "line_items_total": 45000, // Must match the discounted amount

  "notes": {
    "prediscount_applied": "5000"  // Track discount in paise
  },
  "line_items": [
    // ... your line items with original prices
  ]
}
```

**Handy Tips**

Magic Checkout automatically handles all discount calculations on the UI. The system detects differences in checkout amounts and adjusts accordingly.

Error Code, Description and Next Steps

1.6 Integrate with Magic Checkout on Client-Side

Add the Pay button on your web page using the handler function or callback URL.

**Handy Tips**

If your website is running on WooCommerce or Shopify, please integrate with the Razorpay [WooCommerce](/razorpay-docs-md/magic-checkout/woocommerce.md) or [Shopify](/razorpay-docs-md/magic-checkout/shopify.md) plugin based on your requirement.

Advanced Checkout Features

Before implementing the basic integration, understand these advanced features available in Magic Checkout:

Pre-discount Implementation

Display custom discounts (coupons, gift cards, loyalty points) in the checkout order summary before customers enter the checkout flow:

For example, customer adds items to cart:

- T-shirt: ₹499
- Applies gift card (discount): ₹49
- Final amount: ₹450

You can follow the steps given below:

1. Create an order with amount 45000 (₹450 in paise).
2. Add pre-discount in checkout with the following
   - `label`: Gift Card (5AA3Y-E9TZE-82EGJ)
   - `value`: ₹49.
3. Customer views the discount applied in the checkout and pays ₹450.

![View pre-discount on checkout](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/magic-checkout/build/browser/assets/images/magic-web-pre-discount-checkout.jpg) javascript

copy

```javascript
"prefill": {
  "prediscount": [
    {
      "label": "Gift Card (5AA3Y-E9TZE-82EGJ)", 
      "value": "₹49",
      "gift_card_applied": true  // Required for gift cards
    }
  ]
}
```

**Watch Out!**

Pre-discounts are for display only and do not affect the payment amount.

- No calculations are required. Magic Checkout handles everything automatically.
- Payment amount is determined by your Razorpay order, not these display values.
- Pre-discounts show existing discounts only and do not apply new ones.

#### Discount Types

Regular Discounts

Gift Cards

Use for coupons, promotional codes, loyalty points:

javascript

copy

```javascript
{
  "label": "WELCOME20",
  "value": "₹ 200"
}
```

Promotional Tags

Add promotional badges to specific products:

javascript

copy

```javascript
"prefill": {
  "promotional_tag": [
    {
      "tag": "free gift item",
      "variant_id": "1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

1.7 Verify Payment Signature

This is a mandatory step to confirm the authenticity of the details returned to the Checkout form for successful payments.

To verify the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form:

1. Create a signature in your server using the following attributes:

   - `order_id`: Retrieve the `order_id` from your server. Do not use the `razorpay_order_id` returned by Checkout.
   - `razorpay_payment_id`: Returned by Checkout.
   - `key_secret`: Available in your server. The `key_secret` that was generated from the [Dashboard](/razorpay-docs-md/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys)     .
2. Use the SHA256 algorithm, the `razorpay_payment_id` and the `order_id` to construct a HMAC hex digest as shown below:

   HMAC Hex Digest

   copy

   ```json
{
  "id": "order_EKwxwAgItmmXdp",
  "entity": "order",
  "amount": 50000,
  "amount_paid": 0,
  "amount_due": 50000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": "receipt#1",
  "offer_id": null,
  "status": "created",
  "attempts": 0,
  "notes": [],
  "created_at": 1582628071,
  "line_items_total": 50000
}
```0
3. If the signature you generate on your server matches the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form, the payment received is from an authentic source.

Generate Signature on Your Server

Given below is the sample code for payment signature verification:

JavaPythonGoPHPRubyNode.js.NET

copy

```json
{
  "id": "order_EKwxwAgItmmXdp",
  "entity": "order",
  "amount": 50000,
  "amount_paid": 0,
  "amount_due": 50000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": "receipt#1",
  "offer_id": null,
  "status": "created",
  "attempts": 0,
  "notes": [],
  "created_at": 1582628071,
  "line_items_total": 50000
}
```1

Post Signature Verification

After you have completed the integration, you can [set up webhooks](/docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments/), make test payments, replace the test key with the live key and integrate with other [APIs](/razorpay-docs-md/api/index.md).

Here are the links to our [SDKs](/razorpay-docs-md/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard.md#github-and-documentation-links-for-sdks) for the supported platforms.

1.8 Verify Payment Status

Verify the payment status using the APIs and webhooks.

Fetch Payment API

Webhooks

You can fetch the payment details using the [Fetch Payments API](/razorpay-docs-md/api/payments/fetch-with-id.md).

The different payment states are given below:

1.9 Perform Post Payment Processing

Based on the response, you can handle post-payment processing on your end.

**Timeout Handling**

If no API call is made within 45 seconds, our background job will assume there is a network drop off and will proceed to place the order on Shopify automatically.

Use the Fetch Orders API to retrieve order details, including customer information, address, shipping method and promotions of a particular order:

## Go-Live Best Practices

Before going live, make sure to check the following:

- If you configured the above settings in Test Mode, ensure you replicate them in Live Mode.
- Ensure you use API keys generated in Live Mode.
- If you have multiple Razorpay accounts, ensure you use the Live key from the correct account you intend to go live with.
